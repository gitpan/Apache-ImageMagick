 - Updated the list of allowable attribute to write method call, so
   you don't get and unknow attribute error anymore.
 - Added AIMCheckMTime which, when set, cause Apache::ImageMagick
   to compare the modification time of the source and the cached
   image and recompute the result if the source has changed.
 - Added AIMDisableSearch to disable auto conversion of image formats
 - Directory Requests are ignored now, so they can be handled by Apache
   as usual.
 - Add example CGI script in scripts/aimcgi.pl
 - Start with an test suite. You may run it with perl tst/test.pl but
   it may fail on the test which involves fonts, unless you same the
   same fonts as on my test machine.
